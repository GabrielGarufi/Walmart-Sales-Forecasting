# Walmart-Sales-Forecasting
This is a kaggle problem. It is used as an academic project. We have used Time series models to predict weekly sales at store department level of Walmart. This data set is available on the kaggle website. These data sets contained information about the stores, departments, temperature, unemployment, CPI, isHoliday, and MarkDowns.
